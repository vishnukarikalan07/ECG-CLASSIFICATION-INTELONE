# ECG-CLASSIFICATION-INTELONE

The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used medical tool for the diagnosis of heart conditions. The analysis of ECG signals can help in detecting abnormal cardiac conditions, which can be beneficial for the timely diagnosis and treatment of the patients. In this study, we propose a machine learning-based approach for the processing of ECG signals using the values of PQRS complex to detect normal and abnormal signals. The proposed approach utilizes Python-based machine learning algorithms to analyze the ECG signals and extract features from them. The features are then used to classify the signals into normal and abnormal categories and also classify the kind of abnormality.

The data collected from the patients will be stored in the dev cloud so that it can be accessed by the medical professionals during the patient's monthly or yearly check-up. The approach provides a non-invasive and cost-effective solution for the early detection of cardiac abnormalities. The proposed method can also be integrated with other medical devices and systems to create a more comprehensive solution for the diagnosis and treatment of heart diseases. Overall, the proposed approach has the potential to improve the healthcare industry by providing an accurate and reliable method for the detection of cardiac abnormalities.
